# VS Code Schematics

The install schematic will help you quickly add VS Code configuration to a new project. This schematic will:

* Adds recommended extensions
* Configures the [Debugger for Chrome](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug) extension with VS Code to debug an application generated by the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

## Getting Started
- Make sure to have version **6.0.0** or greater of the [@angular/cli](https://cli.angular.io/).
- Run the install schematic
 
```sh
ng add @slupekdev/vscode
```

- Restart VS Code. It prompts a user to install the recommended extensions when a workspace is opened for the first time. The user can also review the list with the Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions command.

## Extensions Included
* [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) - Must have extension for Angular development. You can debug using chrome and add your breakpoints in VSCode. Tutorial on how to use can be found [on VSCode docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/angular-tutorial#_debugging-angular).

* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) - linter for the TypeScript language, help fixing error in TS code. By default auto fixing tslint errors on save is enabled.

* [Angular Language Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Angular.ng-template) - provides a rich editing experience for Angular templates, very useful when working on Angular HTML template.

* [Angular 8 Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikael.angular-beastcode) - Angular with TypeScript snippets.

* [Vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-iconse) - provides lots of icons for Visual Studio Code.

  - `alt+o` (Windows) or `shift+alt+o` (macOS)
  - by default VSCode opens file not opened from file explorer in 'preview' mode. When using this extension, I also recommend the following setting: `workbench.editor.enablePreview": false`

* [Auto Import](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=steoates.autoimport) - Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports.

* [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) - Auto rename paired HTML/XML tag.

* [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer) - allows matching brackets to be identified with colours.

* [Sass Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glen-84.sass-lint) - integrates the sass-lint linter into VS Code.

* [Sort Typescript Imports](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miclo.sort-typescript-imports) - integrates the sass-lint linter into VS Code.

## Debugging
### Prepare test app
- Use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) version **6.0** or greater globally.

  > **Please note**: Dubugging may not function with other versions of Angular CLI.

    ```
    npm install -g @angular/cli@">=6.0"
    ```

- Use Angular CLI to create a new Angular application.

    ```
    ng new my-test-app
    ```

- Change to the newly created application directory and open VS Code.

    ```
    cd my-test-app
    code .
    ```

### Start Debugging

- Set a breakpoint in **app.component.ts** on the line that sets the `title` property of `AppComponent`. To set a breakpoint, click on the gutter to the left of the line numbers. This will set a breakpoint which will be visible as a red circle.

![vscode_debug_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slupekdev/vscode/master/docs/vscode_debug_1.png)

- Open a terminal at the root folder and serve the app using Angular CLI:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

- Go to the Debug view, select the **'ng serve'** configuration, then press F5 or click the green play button.

- The app will be shown in a browser, but in order to hit the breakpoint you'll need to *refresh* the browser.

![vscode_debug_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slupekdev/vscode/master/docs/vscode_debug_2.png)

- You can step through your source code (*F10*), inspect variables such as AppComponent, and see the call stack of the client side Angular application.


### Debug Unit Tests

- Set a breakpoint in **app.component.spec.ts** on a line in one of the unit tests. 

- Open a terminal at the root folder and run the tests using Angular CLI:

  ```
  npm run test
  ```

- After the test run, go to the Debug view, select the **'ng test'** configuration, then press F5 or click the green button.

- When a browser opens with the test list, click the link for the test in which you placed the breakpoint. You should then hit the breakpoint:
